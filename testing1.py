 # ? What we have learned?
 # * we learned that for create a new repository of git we need to write 
 # * git init on this repository.
 # *  then we can track for changes in our file using git add file_name
#* after adding the changes , we can do git status to see whats going on 
# ! dont forget to put git add file_name to update the status for the last change before commiting 
 # * saving tha chnages - git commit -m "updated"
# * if we want to see the commits(our history of changes) we can write git log


# * after one commit , if you want to edit it and commit it again 
# * make the changes , run the code, and the rest is known
# * you can do git diff to see the chnages from the last code
